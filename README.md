# Nifty-50-Financial-Trends

In this project, we conducted a detailed statistical analysis of the Nifty-50 dataset using Python,
modelling, data visualization, summary of statistics, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing
and ANOVA testing.
The goal of this project is to built a complete statistical report using the Nifty-50 dataset which
can be used to conduct financial planning for people. By conducting statistical summary we
will know the average, high, lows etc of the stocks. These insights should be known to the user
so that they can use it and conduct financial planning. Also, by doing modelling, we will predict
whether the person should buy, sell or hold his stocks, which is one of the most important
features of financial planning. Lastly, by conducting hypothesis testing, we can clear rumours
like people buy more stocks on festive days like Diwali etc. This will help the user gain a
complete understanding of the market.
